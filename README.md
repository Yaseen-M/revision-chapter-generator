# Revision Chapter Generator

A personal project of mine that will randomly generate a chapter and a sub-chapter for OCR A Level Computer Science (H446) and Physics (H556).

This helps me to ensure I cover the whole breadth of the course over time and prevent any topics from starvation.

## Instructions to run
- Open [Repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/python3).
- Open [main.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yaseen-M/revision-chapter-generator/master/main.py).
- Copy the Python code from ```main.py``` into the code space in Repl.it.
- Hit run!

_Note: Only the chapters I have studied in school have a chance of being generated._

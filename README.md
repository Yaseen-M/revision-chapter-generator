# Revision Chapter Generator

A personal project of mine that will randomly generate a chapter and a sub-chapter for OCR A Level Computer Science and Physics.

This helps me to ensure I cover the whole breadth of the course over time and prevent any topics from starvation.

## Instructions to run
- Open [Repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/python3).
- Open [main.py](/main.py).
- Copy the Python code from ```main.py``` into the code space in Repl.it.
- Hit run!

_Note: Only the chapters I have studied in school have a chance of being generated._
